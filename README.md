# Emulation_Chip-8

The goal of this project is to emulate the **Chip-8 virtual machine**, in C programming language.

At the end, it will be able to decompile Hexadecimal code to play games on Chip-8.

# Description
Chip-8 is a simple, interpreted, programming language which was first used on some do-it-yourself computer systems in the late 1970s and early 1980s and it was made to allow videogames to be more easily programmed for these computers. The COSMAC VIP, DREAM 6800, and ETI 660 computers are a few examples. These computers typically were designed to use a television as a display, had between 1 and 4K of RAM, and used a 16-key hexadecimal keypad for input.
